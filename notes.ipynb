    "\n",
    "The theory behind PCA rests upon many foundational concepts of linear algebra. After all, PCA is re-encoding a dataset into an alternative basis (the axes). Here are the exact steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recenter each feature of the dataset by subtracting that feature's mean from the feature vector\n",
    "2. Calculate the covariance matrix for your centered dataset\n",
    "3. Calculate the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n",
    "    1. You'll further investigate the concept of eigenvectors in the upcoming lesson\n",
    "4. Project the dataset into the new feature space: Multiply the eigenvectors by the mean-centered features"
