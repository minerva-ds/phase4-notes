    "- **Cold Start Problem**: Difficulty in recommending items to new users without historical data.\n",
    "- **Implicit vs. Explicit Data**\n",
    "  - **Implicit Data**: User behaviors (e.g., click history, time spent on page).\n",
    "  - **Explicit Data**: Direct feedback (e.g., ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Filtering\n",
    "- **Content-Based Filtering**\n",
    "  - Recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "  - Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "  - **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users similar to the target user and recommends items they liked.\n",
    "  - **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items that are similar to items the user liked.\n",

    "\n",
    "Agglomerative clustering is a powerful tool for hierarchical clustering that helps in identifying nested clusters within data. It offers flexibility in terms of linkage criteria and does not require the number of clusters to be predefined. However, it is computationally intensive and requires careful interpretation of dendrograms and threshold settings.\n",

    "### Data Labeling Today: Crowd Workers\n",
    "Data scientists ([and social scientists](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/12/15/how-to-conduct-valid-social-science-research-using-mturk-a-checklist/)) instead frequently use crowdsourcing platforms to label text data cheaply, quickly, and at scale.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### MTurk and Privacy\n",
    "Sending any kind of personally-identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data to a platform like MTurk risks the exposure of this data. A [Microsoft Research team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cscw14-crowdattack.pdf) even found that they could pay MTurk workers to steal user data if it was presented as part of a legitimate task!\n",

Typically a large language model tries to predict the next word or words in a sequence, in a way that can _generate_ text rather than simply labeling it.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks are powerful models that can be customized and tweaked using various amounts of nodes, layers, etc.\n",
    "* The most basic neural networks are single-layer densely connected neural networks, which have very similar properties as logistic regression models\n",
    "* Compared to more traditional statistics and ML techniques, neural networks perform particularly well when using unstructured data\n",
    "* Apart from densely connected networks, other types of neural networks include convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial neural networks \n",
    "* When working with image data, it's important to understand how image data is stored when working with them in Python\n",
    "* Logistic regression can be seen as a single-layer neural network with a sigmoid activation function\n",
    "* Neural networks use loss and cost functions to minimize the \"loss\", which is a function that summarizes the difference between the actual outcome (e.g., pictures contain Santa or not) and the model prediction (whether the model correctly identifies pictures with Santa)\n",
    "* Backward and forward propagation are used to estimate the so-called \"model weights\"\n",
    "* Adding more layers to neural networks can substantially increase model performance\n",
    "* Several activations can be used in model nodes, you can explore with different types and evaluate how it affects performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deep neural network representations can lighten the burden and automate certain tasks of heavy data preprocessing\n",
    "* Deep representations need exponentially fewer hidden units than shallow networks, to obtain the same performance\n",
    "* Parameter initialization, forward propagation, cost function evaluation, and backward propagation are again the cornerstones of deep networks\n",
    "* Tensors are the building blocks of neural networks and a good understanding of them and how to use them in Python is crucial\n",
    "* Scalars can be seen as 0-D tensors. Vectors can be seen as 1-D tensors, and matrices as 2-D tensors\n",
    "* The usage of tensors reaches beyond matrices: tensors can have N dimensions\n",
    "* Tensors can be created and manipulated using NumPy\n",
    "* Keras makes building neural networks in Python easy, and you learned how to do that in this section\n",
    "* You can use Keras to do some NLP as well, e.g. for tokenization \n",

    "## Neural Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll explore the architecture of neural networks. On Monday, we will start working with TensorFlow to create neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks mimic the structure of the human brain and are computational graphs connecting inputs to outputs through layers, including hidden layers. Each connection between layers has associated weights and biases, and uses activation functions to learn relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers and Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer:** Represents features or columns of the dataset.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers that learn from the input features.\n",
    "- **Output Layer:** Provides the final prediction or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron in a hidden layer represents a unique equation and processes inputs to generate outputs for the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Cat vs. Dog Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs (features) are processed through multiple layers to produce an output (e.g., identifying if an image is a cat or a dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Neural Network Training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epoch and Batch Sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epoch:** One full pass through the entire dataset.\n",
    "- **Batch Size:** The number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each epoch consists of multiple batches, and after each batch, the model's weights are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sigmoid:** Often used in the output layer for binary classification.\n",
    "- **Tanh:** Scaled sigmoid function ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Outputs the input if it's positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. Most popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization and Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization prevent overfitting by adding penalties to the loss function.\n",
    "- **Learning Rate:** Determines the step size during gradient descent optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weights and Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weights are initialized randomly and adjusted through training.\n",
    "- Bias terms are added to the weighted sum of inputs to create the neuron's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs are passed through the network layer by layer. Each layer applies weights, sums the inputs, adds biases, and uses activation functions to produce outputs for the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single neuron network (regression):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Forward propagate data through single neuron:\n",
    "<center><img src = \"images/single-unit.png \" width = 900></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "After forward propagation, the error is calculated using a loss function. Backpropagation adjusts the weights by calculating gradients and updating the weights in the direction that reduces the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/backprop.gif\" width = 600>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Code: Forward Propagation and Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize weights and bias\n",
    "weights = np.random.rand(64)\n",
    "bias = np.random.rand(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input features\n",
    "inputs = np.array([0.5, 0.3, ..., 0.9])  # Example values\n",

    "# Output after activation\n",
    "output = sigmoid(z)\n",
    "print(\"Output:\", output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example: Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Image Data:** Flatten images into vectors.\n",
    "2. **Initialize Weights and Biases:** Randomly initialize for each neuron.\n",
    "3. **Forward Propagation:** Calculate weighted sums and apply activation functions.\n",
    "4. **Calculate Error:** Compare predicted outputs with actual labels.\n",
    "5. **Backpropagation:** Adjust weights based on error gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are powerful tools for learning complex patterns and making predictions. They involve intricate processes of forward and backward propagation, weight adjustment, and the use of activation functions. While their workings can seem like a black box, understanding their architecture and training process is crucial for effectively using them in machine learning tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Interpretability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability in machine learning refers to how well we can understand the decisions made by our models. There is no single definition or consensus, but it's crucial to align interpretability with the goals of your machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretability and Machine Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support Human Decisions**: Provides insights to aid human decision-making. For example, Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems like [Watson Health's Micromedex](https://www.ibm.com/watson-health/solutions/clinical-decision-support) help clinicians by offering advice based on patient data and medical knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Watson Health Micromedex](https://www.ibm.com/watson-health/solutions/clinical-decision-support)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate Human Decisions**: Trains models to make decisions independently, such as Natural Language Generation applications used in predictive text and chatbots like ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost and Benefits of Decision Support\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clinical Decision Support (CDS)\n",
    "\n",
    "CDS systems assist clinicians by providing actionable insights from medical data, which can speed up patient care but also introduce potential for false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Clinical Decision Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-tuning-neural-networks-with-regularization/master/images/clinical-decision-support.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal**: Provide reliable recommendations to clinicians. Effectiveness depends on the relevance and accuracy of the information provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computer Aided Detection (CAD)\n",
    "\n",
    "CAD systems enhance diagnostic imaging, such as detecting breast cancer. They offer a \"second opinion\" but may introduce false positives, impacting patient care and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal**: Improve early detection of conditions like cancer. Balancing sensitivity with false positives is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Interpretability Enhances Decision Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability can improve decision support in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trust**: Metrics like accuracy and ROC/AUC show how well the model performs and the nature of its errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Causality**: Helps in understanding relationships between variables, guiding hypotheses and interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transferability**: Assesses whether a modelâ€™s performance is consistent in new scenarios. Understanding decision drivers aids in model tuning and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Informativeness**: Provides insights into feature importance, enhancing domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fair and Ethical Decision Making**: Ensures algorithms do not perpetuate societal biases, fostering accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## White Box vs. Black Box Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, simpler models like regression and decision trees were more interpretable due to their transparency. However, modern complex models, especially neural networks, are often seen as \"black boxes\" because their decision-making processes are less transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **White Box Models**: Transparent and interpretable, such as regression and decision trees.\n",
    "- **Black Box Models**: Complex and less interpretable, such as neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their complexity, black box models can be analyzed using various interpretability techniques."
